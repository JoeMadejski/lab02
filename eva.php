                <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion (Hepburn: Shinseiki Evangerion, lit. "New Century Gospel") is 
                a Japanese mecha anime television series produced by Gainax and Tatsunoko Production, 
                directed by Hideaki Anno and broadcast on TV Tokyo from October 1995 to March 1996. 
                The cast included Megumi Ogata as Shinji Ikari, Kotono Mitsuishi as Misato Katsuragi, 
                Megumi Hayashibara as Rei Ayanami, and Yūko Miyamura as Asuka Langley Soryu. Music for 
                the series was composed by Shirō Sagisu.</p>

                <p>Evangelion is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic
                fortified city of Tokyo-3. The protagonist is Shinji, a teenage boy who was recruited by his 
                father Gendo to the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha called an 
                "Evangelion" into combat with alien beings called "Angels". The series explores the experiences 
                and emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv as they try to prevent any and all of the 
                Angels from causing another cataclysm, and as they deal with the quest of finding out the real 
                truth behind events and organizational moves. The series features imagery derived from Kabbalah, 
                Christianity, and Judaism.</p>

                <p>Neon Genesis Evangelion received critical acclaim but also garnered controversy. Particularly 
                controversial were the last two episodes of the show, leading the team behind the series to 
                produce the original intended version of the ending in the 1997 film The End of Evangelion. 
                Regarded as a deconstruction of the mecha genre, the original TV series led to a rebirth of 
                the anime industry and has become a cultural icon. Film, manga, home video, and other products 
                in the Evangelion franchise have achieved record sales in Japanese markets and strong sales in
                overseas markets, with related goods selling over ¥150 billion by 2007 and Evangelion pachinko 
                machines selling ¥700 billion by 2015.</p>

                <p>2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager Shinji Ikari 
                is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father Gendo Ikari, director of
                the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses United Nations forces battling an Angel, 
                one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
                Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, 
                synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are 
                the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer Misato 
                Katsuragi escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him 
                into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly 
                overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel 
                on its own.</p>

                <p>Following hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his
                    second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts 
                    Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the 
                    remaining 14 Angels in order to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the 
                    world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the 
                    mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl Rei Ayanami. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. 
                    They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager 
                    Asuka Langley Sōryu, who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several 
                    Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. 
                    Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confused feelings for one another, kissing at her 
                    provocation.</p>

                <p>After being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to the Eva acting on its own. He is later forced
                    to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate Toji Suzuhara, 
                    incapacitated and presumably permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and 
                    spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an Angel which attacks her mind and forces 
                    her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei 
                    self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei 
                    alive but claiming she is "the third Rei". Misato forces scientist Ritsuko Akagi to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, 
                    the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with 
                    the DNA of his mother, Yui Ikari. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from 
                    the rest of the characters. Kaworu Nagisa replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially 
                    befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then 
                    realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually 
                    kills Kaworu, causing Shinji to be overriden with guilt.</p>
            
                
                
                <h2>Characters</h2>

                    <figcaption>All characters after merging into Orange Fanta</figcaption>

                </figure>

                <p>Shinji Ikari is the series protagonist and the designated pilot of Evangelion Unit-01. After witnessing 
                his mother Yui Ikari's death as a child, Shinji was abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. He is emotionally 
                hypersensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection, but he has often rebelled and refused 
                to pilot the Eva because of the extremely excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends. 
                Throughout the series, he says to himself "I mustn't run away" as a means of encouraging himself to face the 
                threats of the day, and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle, but he has a lingering habit of 
                withdrawing in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who "shrinks from human contact" 
                and has "convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person".</p>
            
                <p>The withdrawn and mysterious pilot of Evangelion Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, is a clone made from the salvaged remains 
                of Yui and is plagued by a sense of negative self-worth stemming from the realization that she is an expendable asset. 
                She at one time despised Shinji for his lack of trust in his father Gendo, with whom Rei is very close. However, after 
                Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series, 
                it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.</p>
            
                <p>Asuka Langley Soryu is a child prodigy who pilots Evangelion Unit-02 and possesses a fiery temper and an overabundance
                of pride and self-confidence, which often gets her in trouble and difficulty, especially during battles. As a little girl, 
                Asuka discovered the body of her mother shortly after she committed suicide, leading the child to repress her emotions 
                and vow never to cry. Asuka and Shinji develop intense but ambiguous feelings towards each other having difficulty to 
                reach out to others, as their relationship was initially modeled on the one between Jean, Nadia's love interest and 
                eventual husband in the earlier Nadia. Compared to Shinji, Asuka and Rei are presented with their own flaws and difficulty 
                relating to other people.</p>

                <h2>Episodes</h2>
                
                <p> Each episode has two titles: one is the original Japanese title, and the second 
                is an English title that was chosen by Japanese studio Gainax itself and appears 
                as an eye catch. Most often, the official English title is not a direct translation 
                of the Japanese title. For example, the direct translation of the Japanese title of 
                episode 2 is "Unfamiliar Ceilings", but the English title is "The Beast". Sometimes, 
                however, the two titles are either similar or exactly the same, as was the case with 
                the first episode "Angel Attack".</p>

            </ol>


            <h3>Part II</h3>

            <p>The 16th episode marked a distinct shift that would characterize the second half of 
                Evangelion as being more psychological than action or adventure. This change in 
                emphasis was partly due to the development of the story, but also partly because 
                by this point, production had begun running out of funding and failing to meet the 
                schedule; this collapse has been identified by at least episode director Kazuya 
                Tsurumaki as the impetus for Evangelion's turn into internal conflict.</p>
